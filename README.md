==STAFFTEXT

StaffText is designed to let you and your Staff talk easily with one command. Stafftext is designed on letting you and your staff talk or ALL of your staff talk at once! So no more need to whitelist your server just use StaffText!

StaffText is a lightweight plugin. StaffText is designed so you can easily talk to other staff members without having to use ./tell everytime. The other part is once you type ./StaffText (Name) every message you type will only go to them until you type ./StaffText (Name) again. This way you never have to keep typing ./StaffText (Name)

StaffText is mainly for Medium Server's to Larger Server's. As I Server owner myself I understand it is sometimes hard to talk to your staff when 15-23 people are online. I want to turn this into a Staff and support plugin. My Main goal is to make this plugin widely for any kind of server needing a lightweight and easy plugin to use.
